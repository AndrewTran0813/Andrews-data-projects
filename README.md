# Andrews-data-projects
The divvytrip project was an optional project provided by Coursera in order to demonstrate my data analytics skills
I was allowed to choose what programs I wanted to use during the data analysis process
I chose to document all of my analysis process in a word doc
I originally started cleaning and processing my data in Excel but then moved over to R because I felt it would be more efficient
I also have a SQL document that I wrote in MSSQL just showcasing that I have an understanding of SQL functions and could have done the project in SQL if I chose to do so
