# Andrews-data-projects
The divvytrip project was an optional project provided by Coursera in order to demonstrate my data analytics skills
I was allowed to choose what programs I wanted to use during the data analysis process
I chose to document all of my analysis process in a word doc
I originally started cleaning and processing my data in Excel but then moved over to R because I felt it would be more efficient
In the .R file is all the code I wrote, some of it is just fixing some errors that occurred when I imported the excel files into R
I had the option to use any program I was comfortable with for the data visualization at the end, I decided that the visualization I created in R was sufficient.
